Commands

-----------------------

I think 99% of commands should be realm-local.

The remainder are special cross-realm private commands. They can be specially registered.

A command can be registered to a specific cmd char (e.g. * or ?). The cmdman checks the dict cmds tied to a specific char first, then checks the general cmd dict. If both of these fail, a catch all is called (possibly allow registering a char specific catch all?).
