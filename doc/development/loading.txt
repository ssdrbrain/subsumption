Loading Components
==================

Introduction

Components are python classes with a special @decorator applied to their definition.

I need to explain the mess of the python loading struct, and how it gets built by decorators and iterated by compman.

It may be nice to pass arguments to components. Additionally, a facility for renaming the component where it's possible to have duplicates might be a good idea. E.g. one could load a net component called 'primary' on port X and another called 'secondary' on port Y. This needs more thought. It may be a terrible idea :)
